      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ENB EliteCup 2017 is a football tournament between the master programs of the Elite Network of Bavaria that takes place every year.
This year, we jumped at the opportunity to participate and assembled a neuroengineering team, called &amp;lsquo;The Neuruns&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the odds of being still a very small program and some of us not being able to play due to Ramadan, we managed to form a team of sufficiently many players.
Our thanks goes to Lukas, a PhD student at the NST, and ⁠⁠⁠Davide, a Neuroscience student at LMU, for reinforcing our team.
We were furthermore very happy to have Prof. Conradt in our team who brought some structure into our otherwise chaotic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides having by far the highest participation rate of all master programs, we also had the highest number of female players with Pooja and Auguste who were doing an amazing job in our defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tournament started with a group phase, where we had a stellar performance and qualified without problems for the elimination rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/football.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not really&amp;hellip; ;) One of our opponents had dropped out of the tournament and therefore we had a bye to the elimination round even without winning any games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the quarter final we had the bad luck of facing the CDTM1 team which later on won the tournament. The game against them was a fierce battle with them playing, admittedly, beautiful football and us trying our hardest to defend against their onslaught. Especially our goalkeeper, Bashiri, was an absolute beast in this game and even defended a penalty kick.
Even though we did our best and our team play had improved tremendously since the first game, team CDMT1 bested us and we were eliminated from the tournament.
But at least we didn&amp;rsquo;t loose as high against them as other teams ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing on the grass next to the football fields, having some cold beer while watching the remaining games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/beer_selfie.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are a great football player, we encourage you to apply to the MSNE program. We can use back up in the coming tournaments. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank the organizers for the great tournament as well as TNG Technology Consulting for sponsoring lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spring 2017 MSNE Retreat took place in Fischen, Allgäu from May 14 to May 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the MSNE Students, we welcomed the following speakers for invited talks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thursday: &lt;a href=&#34;http://bethgelab.org/people/matthias/&#34;&gt;Prof. Dr. Matthias Bethge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://bethgelab.org/&#34;&gt;Bethge Lab&lt;/a&gt;, University of Tübingen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/neuroinformatik/mitarbeiter/hneumann/&#34;&gt;Prof. Dr. Heiko Neumann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/neuroinformatik/&#34;&gt;Institut für Neuroinformatik&lt;/a&gt;, University of Ulm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday: Dr. Dmitry Kireev, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fz-juelich.de/pgi/pgi-8/EN/Home/_node.html&#34;&gt;Institute of Bioelectronics&lt;/a&gt;, Forschungszentrum Jülich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;retreat-proceedings&#34;&gt;Retreat Proceedings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proceedings of the retreat are available &lt;a href=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/170514_MSNE_Proceedings.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cherishable-retreat&#34;&gt;The Cherishable Retreat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pranshulsaini17.wordpress.com/2017/06/01/the-cherishable-retreat&#34;&gt;Pranshul Saini&amp;rsquo;s personal Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first trip of the students of Masters of Science in Neuroengineering made its flight on 11th May, 2017. A long awaited event, fuelled by the energy and insatiable enthusiasm of a bunch of budding Neuroengineers, embarked on forming its path in the play of time. Although it was not the best start as Nicolas and I were leaving Munich around 12 pm, let’s not go through the details of “why”, whereas our friends left around 10 AM in the morning. My journey began with philosophical discussions with Nicolas over a variety of topics, such as what is passion, what is education’s importance and how the current education system can be improved, and so on and so forth. Little did I know that this train journey would turn into such a nice flow of thoughts, along with a forthcoming surprise. After about 1 and half hours, one of our friends, Christoph, suddenly showed up. We later couldn’t stop our laughter that our friends had taken a long route mistakenly. Now all of us, except two people who came by car, were on the same train heading towards Fischen together, ergo reminding me that it is worth having patience sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/retreat/img_2017.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had booked a nicely located house in Fischen, which we reached around 4 PM. We were lucky that Auguste had brought her car, and she and Steffen already had most of the needed food items. Having realised that Prof. Bethge was about to arrive in about 3 hours, we had little time to falter. We pieced up ourselves quickly, and started preparing dinner together, important to mention that we also enjoyed playing volleyball in between :).  After the arrival of Prof. Bethge, everyone was eager to know what he was going to talk about. Yes, it was all a surprise by then. We thought that whatever the topic, it would be interesting for us. He talked about the algorithms and neuro-computational design principles of perceiving neural networks. The talk was afterwards followed by the card game Bang-bang, and long informal discussions with Prof. Bethge as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/retreat/img_1710.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next morning, Christoph, sleeping next to me, got up around 7 AM in the morning for running. The next moment, we find Bashiri in the kitchen. After I finished my meditation, the three of us went for a short run, Bashiri and I were clearly not prepared for an uphill run after a drunken night but we persevered somehow. The sun had just started shining in the faint gold of spring. We then joined other people in the Kitchen to prepare the breakfast. The discussion about the effectiveness of meditation spread over the table. I got to know a fun fact that one of my friends, I am trying to be polite by not divulging his name, used to think HATHA yoga as HOT yoga. Nevertheless, I think it’s an easier way to advertise it :p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/retreat/img_2073.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professor Bethge soon departed after lunch, and then Prof. Neumann arrived. In his presence, some of us presented the work we had done recently during our 6-week research project. It was interesting to know about each other’s work, and also get the professor’s feedback at the same time. In between, Dr. Dmitriv also arrived to join all of us. Following the lunch, Prof. Neumann started talking about his work in the understanding of the visual system, from technological as well as from the biological perspective. He ironed out the need of having clear benchmarks in the field of Computational Neuroscience. Afterwards, Steffen talked about his research project, while Pooja and I started making Indian dishes in parallel for the dinner. Professor Neumann left after the dinner, in fact, he couldn’t finish his dinner because it got a bit late and he had to catch his train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/retreat/img_1781.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Dmitriv talked about his work with experimental techniques in the field of Neuroscience. Thereafter, we planned to walk, some people called it a hike but it wasn’t actually, except for some adventures, until the train station to see Dmitriv off. I am not sure though if he really liked the idea or not. Some of us chose a relatively challenging narrow terrain, which didn’t quite turned out well for our super-excited Nicolas, ending up twisting his right ankle. We have some pretty nice pictures for our readers to witness his condition. Anyways, he continued the journey with a brave face, or at least pretended to maintain one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/retreat/img_1871.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/retreat/img_1873.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing Dmitriv off at the train station, we played volleyball and Frisbee for some time, and then continued back with our so-called-hiking, with the fleeting nature of unparalleled alpine landscapes and golf course on our way. I also got to know that most of business in the United States and South Korea takes place on a golf course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/retreat/img_1930.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of you may have presumed by now that as Dmitriv and all the professors have left, it’s going to be the end of our discussion sessions. But you know, being the pioneer batch, we had to keep our spirits high, impervious to the tiredness. Ann (you could simply say N as well) presented about the head transplant, which indeed raised the nerves of many of us. The meal was special on that night, which was barbeque dinner on the lawn. Apparently, James loved it so much that half of the chicken was on his plate already, and the rest of us somehow managed with the spared parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/retreat/img_2287.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, the talk that I loved the most was presented by Nicolas in a reticent way, which discussed Cognitive Enhancement and Ethics. The following talk was given by Adballah where he related consciousness with quantum physics phenomena. By then, most us were dead tired, and some whisked into their rooms while some continued to join for my talk. I talked about the concept of free will and how it’s understanding can help us perceive  people’s actions in a different way. By the end of the talk, Christoph had started dozing off comfortably. The discussion afterwards helped me know how much my talk had annoyed some people, actually now I realise that it doesn’t feel nice to say that we don’t have free will. Steffen, Abdallah, myself, and Ann, I think if it were in her hands, she would have killed me :p, kept discussing about it until 3 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/retreat/img_2305.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We soon picked up the last leg of our trip. Yes, we had to leave, and some of us didn’t want to, at least I didn’t want to. Soon after breakfast, Christoph talked about the future of health and applications of Artificial Intelligence in medicine in the startup domain. Thereafter, we cleaned the house and walked to the station, we called that hiking as well, with great pride. This was a memorable trip in true terms, which ended with in a jubilant mood for everyone. I hardly imagined that we could learn so much from each other, combined with great fun in an erudite culture. We got to know each other way better, everyone would invariably agree in Christoph’s case, developed deeper bonds, and cooperated like a team. Auguste, Steffen, and Christoph definitely took the most important lead, and everyone did the best to make the stay pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/retreat/img_2206.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my personal experience, I would definitely recommend such events when you are just with your friends, without any internet,  thisbecause is the most important factor is to focus on each other, talking and enjoying with no track of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the story goes on….&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Participation in the Munich Brain Course</title>
      <link>https://msne2016.github.io/2017/04/01/participation-in-the-munich-brain-course</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2017 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://msne2016.github.io/2017/04/01/participation-in-the-munich-brain-course</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a semester of interesting theoretical lectures in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology we had the chance of gaining practical hands-on experience about the human brain in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intensivkurs-neuroanatomie.de/&#34;&gt;Munich Brain Course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Munich Brain Course is a yearly intensive course on neuroanatomy organized by the  &lt;em&gt;Institute of Anatomy&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU)&lt;/em&gt; - the non-technical university in Munich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course started in the morning with a nice welcome buffet. Strengthened by the snacks and the coffee, we learned about the century-long history of neuroscience research in Munich and about the structure and organization of the course during an introductory talk and then had the pleasure to hear from Prof. Dr. Benedikt Grothe how the brain evolved over the last half billion years. We were surprised that the first precursors of the central nervous systems existed as early as 500 million years ago, when the first bilateral animals (having a head and a tail instead of being radially symmetric like a jellyfish) evolved. A few million years later the first fish with jaws came into being and in parallel &amp;lsquo;invented&amp;rsquo; the cerebellum to solve the complex motion control of jaw movement. Eyes, ears, hands and feet are obviously brilliant evolutionary innovations, but who would have thought that jaws were just as important and that their evolution is responsible for the part of our brain containing around 75% of our neurons?
Prof. Grothe&amp;rsquo;s great lecture was followed by an introduction to the first of the three hands-on sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the lectures, the practical sessions were conducted in the anatomic theatre where we were first given a plastic skirt and medical gloves. Then we gathered in small groups of 4-6 students around the tables, each with a tutor and a brain.  All three tutors that my group had in the three sessions were practicing neurosurgeons who were all very knowledgeable as well as great teachers. They all had an interactive style and liked to quiz us on the location and function of different brain structures. This is where our lectures in neuroanatomy and -physiology came in handy.
Some of us, me included, were quite sceptical about seeing and touching  a human brain - not to speak of dissecting one. And indeed, at first there was an awkward feeling and we students were quite reserved about touching the brain when we were told to remove the dura mater. This turned out to be a quite difficult task because the cerebellar tentorium, the part of the dura mater that separates the cerebellum and the occipital lobe, was stuck. It felt strange to take appart something that was not long ago the central part of a person. But then I came to realize that the best way to show respect to the brain&amp;rsquo;s donor was to use this opportunity to learn as much as possible. He or she donated it for the purpose of educating scientists, engineers and medical doctors that would later use the insight gained by the inspection of their brain to improve the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while I was able to shift into a scientific perspective which made the nausea disappear.
The dura mater is the first part of the meninges, the three membranes that envelop the brain. The other two are the arachnoid layer which contains the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the pia mater which is impermeable to the CSF and envelops the cortex. After the removal of the outer membranes of the brain we were able to see the gyri and sulci of the cortex and inspect the subarachnoid cisterns. We also recapitulated our knowledge about the lobes of the cortex and the parts of the brain stem.
In the following hands-on sessions we learned to identify the twelve pairs of cranial nerves and their function. Furthermore we learned about the folding of the cortex during evolution and the language system arch on the dominant cerebral hemisphere, from Wernicke&amp;rsquo;s area on the superior temporal gyrus, which is involved in language understanding, over the parts of the primary motor cortex that control the lips and the tongue to Broca&amp;rsquo;s area, on the inferior frontal gyrus, which is responsible for language production.
Afterwards, we cut the brain into slices which helped to identify several of the subcortical structures like the basal ganglia, the thalamus and the hippocampus.&lt;br /&gt;
In between the practical sessions there were several lectures given by experts in neuroanatomy as well as a great keynote lecture on Friday evening by Prof. Peter Redgrave from the University of Sheffield, who talked about the basal ganglia&amp;rsquo;s role in action selection. Another highlight was a live obduction of a brain performed by Prof. Andreas Bütter and Prof. Matthias Graw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Munich Brain Course was a great learning opportunity. Having dissected and inspected a human brain by ourselves changes the relationship to the object of our studies and makes the theoretical concepts tangible. We felt well prepared for the course owing to the MSNE lectures in neuroanatomy and -physiology and believe that the Munich Brain Course was a perfect practical complement to those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was also a great opportunity for our batch to get together after not seeing each other during the lecture free period. Therefore, in the lunch breaks we bought a huge pile of pita bread and some dips from a Turkish shop and gathered on the staircase of a neighboring building to eat and enjoy the sunny spring weather together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our attendence was organized and paid for by the MSNE program and the ENB, so we&amp;rsquo;d like to thank them and the organizers of the Munich Brain Course for the very informative two days.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1st Human Brain Project student conference in Vienna</title>
      <link>https://msne2016.github.io/2017/02/10/1st-human-brain-project-student-conference-in-vienna</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://msne2016.github.io/2017/02/10/1st-human-brain-project-student-conference-in-vienna</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In February, Raja, Abdallah, James and Nicolas had the chance to attend the first student conference of the European Human Brain Project in Vienna. This study trip was carried out within the MSNE program and was supported by the Elite Network of Barvaria (ENB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having already brought our suitcases to the final exam in &lt;em&gt;Computational Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, we started our trip directly after handing in our solutions. Late in the evening, after a four-hour train ride, we finally arrived in Vienna and checked in at our hotel which was in walking distance to the university of Vienna where the conference was hosted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next morning we joined a free-walking tour. Fighting the freezing cold we made our way through the city and learned a lot about the glorious history of the Autro-Hungarian Empire.
The amount of beautiful historic buildings was absolutely mindblowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch the conference started with a welcome talk and a couple of lectures by senior researchers in the HBP. In between the lectures there were lightning talks where students shortly gave an overview of their research and invited the audience to meet them for discussions at their scientific posters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final talk of the first day was followed by a welcome buffet where we met a researcher from Heidelberg with whom we had a long and interesting conversation about the history and technology of neuromorphic computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/170205-1-hbp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the two following days there were many more interesting talks on a broad range of topics associated with the HBP as well as more student presentations which culminated in the poster session. In total, the lectures that were given at the HBP student conference ranged from computational neuroscience, neurorobotics, neuroimaging, molecular neuroscience, machine learning applied to neurological data to neuromorphic hardware.
As addition to the technical talks there was also a presentation and discussion about the ethics of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was a great opportunity for us to meet other students with an interest in neuroscience and technology - from Norway through Jülich and Heidelberg to South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://msne2016.github.io/img/170205-3-hbp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the HBP student conference was a hugely interesting and inspiring event.
It was especially nice to see how well the first semester in the Neuroengineering program had prepared us to understand the lectures. We learned that the HBP isn&amp;rsquo;t a traditional neuroscience project but instead is about the interdisciplinary merger of neuroscience and ICT. Therefore studying neuroengineering seems like the perfect preparation for getting involved in the HBP, which some of our batch are actually doing now in the form of research projects and student jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank the MSNE program and the ENB for their support which made this great experience possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nicolas Berberich&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 9th we met with the MSNE program manager, Florian Rattei, at one of the many Christkindl-Markets in Munich for some nice hot Glühwein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medival-themed market with its many craftsmen and -women including a glassblower, a goldsmith and calligraphers as well as the authentic wooden stalls immediately makes one forget the stressful daily routine and emits a traditional Christmassy atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing around a stump that served as a table for our Glühwein cups, we also talked about organisational matters and planned activities like the writing of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are students from the Master of Science program in Neuroengineering (MSNE) at the Technical University in Munich and are using this site to share our experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog serves two purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to write a diary about the many great things that we are doing and experiencing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The blog is also supposed to give information to students interested in joining the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
